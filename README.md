# planit

## Overview
This is an events app where you can see current and future events. Some events are private, some are public, some are free and open to everyone, and some cost money. Users can post events, give admin access to others, friend people, message them, and chat in group chats for events they RSVP to. The app sends reminders about event times and locations, and allows users to post photos of events.
